<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
<h3>Content Strategy:</h3>
<p>My site will be one page and will be structured in the following order:</p>
<h4>Navbar:</h4>
<p>The Navbar will feature links that will take the user to the desired area of the page.</p>
<h4>About me:</h4>
<p>This section will introduce the subject of the website and have a picture that shows him. Inside of this section it will have information on the sales experience he brings along with a personal quote from him or a catch phrase. This will contain information on why he loves his job and how that is good for you.</p>
<h4>Picture Slideshow Section</h4>
<p>This section of the page will have pictures from previous sales. This will be a slideshow where the customer can click the pictures from left to right and they will loop.</p>
<h4>Inventory Link/URL</h4>
<p>This will simply be a link that directs the user of the site to an inventory site that is not connected to this website.</p>
<h4>Contact Me Section</h4>
<p>This will be a contact form at the bottom of the page. The purpose for this is to be contacted for a car purchase after providing the details requested.</p>
<h4>Footer</h4>
<p>The footer will contain the following information about my role as a web developer. That will be followed by my name, the year, and links to my Linked In and Github accounts.
</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
The website will be formatted to be viewable on both mobile devices as well as desktop versions for maximum exposure.
