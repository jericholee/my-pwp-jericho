<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
<h3>Content Strategy:</h3>
<p>My site will be one page and will be structured in the following order:</p>
<h4>Navbar:</h4>
<p>The Navbar will feature links that will take the user to the desired area of the page.</p>
<h4>About me:</h4>
<p>This section will introduce the subject of the website and have a picture that shows him. Inside of this section it will have information on the sales experience he brings along with a personal quote from him or a catch phrase. This will contain information on why he loves his job and how that is good for you.   </p>
